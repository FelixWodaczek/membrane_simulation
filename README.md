# Membrane Simulation using Trilmp

Lightweight wrapper code around trilmp to manage simulations.

## Install

Requires a full install of Šarić-group's `trimem-sbeady`, so follow instructions [here](https://github.com/Saric-Group/trimem_sbeady) to create the conda environment `trienv`.
After this has been done, use `pip install --editable .`, which installs an editable version of this into the directory.
